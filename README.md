# Manim
This is for the videos I create using Manim. There will be a few sections for this.

## Math 618

In this course I am going to make a video discussing an introduction to Principal Component Analysis. The plan is to make a video discussing why this should be done in a visual manner starting off with eigenvalues.

## Math 161

I will potentially be making a couple of videos for Calc 2 as I will be teaching that in the Spring of 2024.
