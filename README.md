# Manim
This is for the videos I create using Manim. There will be a few sections for this. I am going to learn blender as well to add sound and also for 3d modeling.

## Math 618

In this course I am going to make a video discussing an introduction to Principal Component Analysis. The plan is to make a video discussing why this should be done in a visual manner starting off with eigenvalues.

This video was finished but it is a bit rough. I like the idea of trying to show how these concepts flow into each other but this was the first video I made using this software and it shows. I will go back and fix it later.

## Math 161

I will potentially be making a couple of videos for Calc 2 as I will be teaching that in the Spring of 2024.


## Leaving Certificate

I am making some content in maths for the Leaving certificate and I think having nice visuals would get the point across better.
